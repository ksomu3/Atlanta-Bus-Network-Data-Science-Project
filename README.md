# Atlanta-Bus-Network-Data-Science-Project

This project develops a regression model to predict bus travel time on selected low On-Time Performance (OTP) routes operated by MARTA (Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority). The model uses engineered features from multiple sources including weather, traffic, passenger activity, operator behavior, and vehicle maintenance. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is used to interpret the modelâ€™s predictions. For more in depth context, please review the report. 

## Main Notebook

- **`Consolidated_data.ipynb`**: Contains data processing, feature engineering, model training, and SHAP analysis.

## How to Use

1. Download the full dataset and notebook: [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cQY5cjyrDEXZ-b20WAeYJzlw6TOnhOGP?usp=drive_link)
2. Open `Consolidated_data.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab.
3. Ensure the following Python packages are installed:
